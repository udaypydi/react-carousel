## Why?
There are some great carousels (like slick) that do not have real React implementations. This library provides you with carousel that is not merely a wrapper for some jQuery solution, can be used as controlled or uncontrolled element (similar to [inputs](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)), and has tons of useful features.

## Installation
Install the library:
```
$ npm i @brainhubeu/react-carousel
```

And then you can import Carousel and Dots components:
```
import Carousel, { Dots } from '@brainhubeu/react-carousel';
import '@brainhubeu/react-carousel/lib/style.css';
```

You can find usage examples [here](/docs/examples/simpleUsage/)
